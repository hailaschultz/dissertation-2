Download data from NANOOS website:
I first went to https://nvs.nanoos.org/CruiseSalish and downloaded all relevant files. I moved them to the NANOOS-files folder. I unzipped them manually
```{bash}
#find current directory
pwd
```

move all upcast files to the upcast folder
```{bash}
#move directories
cd /Users/hailaschultz/Dropbox/Schultz_Dissertation/Data_Analysis/Schultz_dissertation-2/data/NANOOS_files

find . -name '*labupcast.xlsx' -exec mv {} ../NANOOS_files/upcasts/ \;
```
